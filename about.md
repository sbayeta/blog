My name is Santiago Bayeta, and I'm an Electronics Engineer and a software developer.

I've worked in the Electronics Manufacturing industry since 2004. I started working as a Process
Engineer for Deplhi Automotive Systems, where I received training regarding world-class best practices.
Later grew into leadership positions and switched companies. Throughout all my career I've tried to use
technology and science to improve operations and reduce costs.

Around 2013 I started working as a freelance consultant, specializing in process automation using
open source software. I also consult regarding operations management, new factory setups, and
manufacturing issues in general. In addition to this, I also do contract software development and consulting.
